# 🎓 Intermediate School System OOP

A modular, C++-based console application simulating a real-world school management system.  
It includes account creation, login, personalized data files, and multiple educational panels.

---

## 🧩 Features

### 🔐 Account System
- User-generated username and PIN
- Login screen with credential verification
- Each user has their own `.txt` file to store data

### 📚 Student Panels
- 🧠 IQ Test  
- 🇬🇧 English Test  
- 💸 Balance Panel (Tuition payment system)  
- 📝 Subject Panel (Add/update/remove subjects and grades)  
- 📆 Absences Panel  
- 🎓 Scholarship Evaluation  
- 🪪 Student Card Generator

### 🧾 File Handling
- `student.txt` used as global registry  
- Individual `username.txt` files for per-student data  
- All file operations handled with `fstream`

### ⚙️ Project Structure
- Each module in its own `.cpp` / `.hpp` file inside `Utils/`
- CMake build system ready (`CMakeLists.txt`)
- Clean and scalable design

---
## 🧠 Developer Note

- All data handling and logic are centralized within `student.cpp` and `student.hpp`.
- The codebase is designed with a focus on clarity, modularity, and clean architecture.
- Standard C++ file I/O (`fstream`, `ofstream`, `ifstream`) was used exclusively — no external libraries.
- This version is fully console-based. A **Qt GUI version** is planned for future development.

> ⚠️ Note: There are known bugs when writing student subjects using `ofstream` and arrays.  
> These will be addressed after planned feature implementations and upcoming project iterations.
